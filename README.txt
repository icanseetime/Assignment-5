# Welcome to assignment 5!

## Notes - general

- Added minutes as an attribute of time, mostly because of consistency ("Cooking temperature" and "Quantity" are set up the same way)
- Have not used "prettyprint", because tabs are more readable than spaces :) 


## Notes for a5-2
- Added timeInterval as attribute with a restriction that makes you choose between minutes and hours. (Those two time units seemed like the most natural ones for cooking time.)
